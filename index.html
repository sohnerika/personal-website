    <!-- Introduction Text -->
    <p>
        Hi there! I’m Erika, a third-year student at Northeastern University majoring in 
        Data Science and Finance. This website is a space where I share my projects, 
        academic explorations, and personal interests. I love solving complex problems
        via logic, quantitative, and qualitative analysis. Whether it be analyzing 
        financial market volatility or predicting diabetes risk, I'm fascinated by how
        vast amounts of data can be transformed into insights that drive decisions. Beyond 
        the classroom, I enjoy playing tennis and pickleball, as well as cafe hopping. 
        I also really like to travel!
        
        Through this website, I hope to showcase the projects and passions that define my 
        journey as a student. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore my page for 
        more details about me and my work! 
    </p>
