    <!-- Introduction Text -->
    <p>
        Hi there! I’m Erika, a third-year student at Northeastern University majoring in 
        Data Science and Finance. This website is a space where I share my projects, 
        academic explorations, and personal interests. I love diving into complex problems 
        and finding creative solutions that combine logic, analytics, and technology. 
        From analyzing financial data to exploring social media sentiment, I’m fascinated 
        by how information can be transformed into insights that drive decisions. Beyond 
        the classroom, I enjoy experimenting with music production, digital art, and 
        photography, as well as staying active with tennis and Pilates. Traveling and 
        experiencing different cultures inspires me and helps me approach problems with 
        fresh perspectives. Through this website, I hope to showcase the projects and 
        passions that define my journey as a student and a creative problem solver. 
        Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore the About page for more details 
        about me and my work.
    </p>
